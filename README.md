# Digit recognition #
Digit recognition with the use of a simple feed-forward neural network made in Scala.

It is using the library **simple-scala-nn** made by **nietaki** : https://github.com/nietaki/simple-scala-nn

*Simple Scala NN is a scala implementation of (for now) feed-forward neural networks. It is designed to be simple (easy to use, understand and modify), flexible (arbitrary number of neurons and hidden layers, different activation functions), and reasonably fast (vectorized and clutter-free).*
